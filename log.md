# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my first react-native project by installing all the dependencies and succesfully created my first component! 

**Thoughts** So far so good: Getting into the whole writing JSX elements. It's probably going to take a while but I don't mind a challenge ;)

### Day 2: January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about setting up new components in different files and import them into the main index file. Also learned how to you can apply some styling to a component.

**Thoughts** Making seperate components for specific elements seems logical. Still need to read more about states and props, but it seems really handy to re-use different components without copying the same code everytime.
