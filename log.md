# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my first react-native project by installing all the dependencies and succesfully created my first component! 

**Thoughts** So far so good: Getting into the whole writing JSX elements. It's probably going to take a while but I don't mind a challenge ;)

### Day 2: January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about setting up new components in different files and import them into the main index file. Also learned how to you can apply some styling to a component.

**Thoughts** Making seperate components for specific elements seems logical. Still need to read more about states and props, but it seems really handy to re-use different components without copying the same code everytime.

### Day 3: January 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read more about the difference between states and props in React. Succesfully retreived data from a https request and rendered it in the app. 

**Thoughts** Have to put more effort in learning the ema script 2016 format. Also slowly beginning to understand the use of state and props in react. Did not have much time the past two days, will put more effort into this project over the weekend
