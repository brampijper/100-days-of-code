# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my first react-native project by installing all the dependencies and succesfully created my first component! 

**Thoughts** So far so good: Getting into the whole writing JSX elements. It's probably going to take a while but I don't mind a challenge ;)

### Day 2: January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about setting up new components in different files and import them into the main index file. Also learned how to you can apply some styling to a component.

**Thoughts** Making seperate components for specific elements seems logical. Still need to read more about states and props, but it seems really handy to re-use different components without copying the same code everytime.

### Day 3: January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read more about the difference between states and props in React. Succesfully retreived data from a https request and rendered it in the app. 

**Thoughts** Have to put more effort in learning the ema script 2016 format. Also slowly beginning to understand the use of state and props in react. Did not have much time the past two days, will put more effort into this project over the weekend

### Day 4: January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Further implementation of props in my components by creating an extra component called AlbumDetails that the AlbumList component is using to render extra information about the albums. 

**Thoughts** I made a small to do list, because I noticed that I'm struggling to really understand the use of props and state in React. Another thing is that I need to read more about the ES6
 syntax style. The arrow functions are easy and I also understand the difference between let, const and var but there's much more! Also thinking about following some basic react tutorials to get more knowledge about the pure basics of react (for example things like: every component is required to have a render function)

### Day 5: January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've created multiple components purely for styling other components. I also learned about props.children, which comes in really handy if you want to apply the styling to multiple instances. 

**Thoughts** I'm slowly getting the gasp of props. I still have to read more about the ES2016 syntax. I am also wondering about the differences between  the react native and react.js library. They probably have a lot in common so it will be nice to set-up a react based project after succesfully learning react-native.

### Day 6: January 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Couple of small things I learned today: 
    1. I learned about reconstructing props if you use them multiple times. (which cleans up your code)
    2. Using images in react (without setting the width and height elements react doesn't render the image)
    3. Justify content and Flex direction properties (Handy for positioning multiple elements in react native)

**Thoughts** Got stuck for a bit by forgetting curly braces, when reconstructing the props element. Which was kind of frustrating but I found it rather quickly before I was getting frustrated. ;) Also learning about the flexbox properties was not that hard.

### Day 7: January 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first app that is displaying my favourite albums with react native. Also began to work on my second app. 
    Today I learned about:
    1. How to implement scrolling in React Native. (add a scrollview tag)
    2. How to implement buttons in React Native. (and add an onPress function)
    3. I Got more insights in re-usable components in react native. So don't hardcode value's in components if you're planning on using them multiple times in your project.
    4. I learned a bit about the use of Firebase. (a quick & secure way to authenticate users)
    5. Learned more about destructing re-usable components in react native. 

**Thoughts** I was excited to finish my first application that i've been building with react native. Eventhough it's a really basic app it was a good start to get to know the basics of React Native.
I am now looking forward to learn more advanced stuff (already started on building an authenticator app with Firebase.) Still struggling a bit with props and states but I think I will get the hang of it if I use it more often.

### Day 8: January 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about input fields in React Native, couple of things:
    1. Getting the hang of using props (I understand the logic behind them)
    2. re-usable components are awesome :)

**Thoughts** Repetition really helps when making re-usable components, using props -> I now understand them mostly! Hopefully this will also work with states and class based components!

### Day 9: January 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finally managed to use the firebase authentication functions. The user can now create an account and log-in. I Also managed to implement a conditional statement in JSX.

**Thoughts** Currently using states a lot in react, which starts to make sense to me. Now the term this is kind of confusing me so I will have to read more about that. Also creating and using functions to refacture some pieces of code is almost the same as in Javascript :)

### Day 10: January 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my basic authentication app -> User can now create an account with an email / password and log-in & log-out! 

**Thoughts** I implemented my first switch statement which was easy to do. Still a bit confused about the 'this' reference. Also during the weekend I want to add some more features to this basic app (which is not in a tutorial), so I will probably have to Google a lot!

### Day 11: January 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a change email adress feature once the user is logged in. Still very basic, but it works. 

**Thoughts** Since the tutorial on React Native is hopping to building the third app I first decided  to improve the authentication app. I think it's a good way to practice react native on my own. Planning on adding more features: Change the user's password, make it more user friendly and I am going to try to implement a google or facebook log-in!

### Day 12: January 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Before changing an email-adress the user must now re-authenticate with his password. 

**Thoughts** After using more state properties, I understand it more easily. Also the 'this' property makes more sense now.

### Day 13: January 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Went through my authentication code to really understand what i've been building so far. 

**Thoughts** After going through some code I decided to read more about Javascript. One of my collegeues recommended "You don't know js". After finding it on Github I decided to give it a try and it's good so far! I read about the differences between ES2016 and ES2015. Also looking into this & Object Prototypes.

### Day 14: January 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set-up a basic redux application.

**Thoughts** After learning the basics of react native it was time to take the next step by diving myself into Redux. Which is important to learn if your app needs to scale. Big projects with the least amount of code complexicity. I think I understand the concept, however it will take some practice and repetition before I can write application with the use of redux myself.

### Day 15: January 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a ListView component

**Thoughts** Redux is hard, but just trying to gaps the different way of writing an application. I want to put more time in learning but since im tired now I call it a day. Made many typo's today (probably related to me being tired), but at least it's a good way to practice and learning my code.

### Day 16: January 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Applied some quick styling and learned about connect function.

**Thoughts** Redux is still hard! Coding from the train is not the best but it's better then nothing! Also this application is not that exciting so im already looking forward to the next one :)

### Day 17: January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Redux test application & aplied an animation. 

**Thoughts** Understanding Redux is hard but I get the process of Reducers, States and Store. I just need to practice more often so I understand it really good. Exciting to work on the next application which will be much bigger than this one :)

### Day 18: January 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Re-made the Redux boilerplate + set-up new project. 

**Thoughts** Walking through the Redux boilerplate was good to do. I've noted all the steps that are required for setting up a new redux project. It was a good way to reflect the things I learned so far.
