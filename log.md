# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my first react-native project by installing all the dependencies and succesfully created my first component! 

**Thoughts** So far so good: Getting into the whole writing JSX elements. It's probably going to take a while but I don't mind a challenge ;)
